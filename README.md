# üè• Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction & Analysis

## üîç Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **no-shows in healthcare appointments**‚Äîa widespread problem in public health systems that causes inefficient use of medical resources and delays for other patients. To address this, we‚Äôve developed a complete data science pipeline involving:

- üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to discover trends and patterns in patient behavior.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning (ML) models** to predict the likelihood of no-show events.
- üìà **Power BI Dashboard** to provide an interactive and visual summary of patient behavior trends and key risk factors for no-shows.

### üéØ Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

- To understand **demographic**, **behavioral**, and **medical** factors that contribute to patients missing scheduled medical appointments.
- To explore the **effectiveness of SMS reminders** and other hospital interventions.
- To build accurate **classification models** that can predict whether a patient will attend their appointment.
- To develop a **dashboard** that enables healthcare administrators to make **data-driven decisions** to reduce no-shows and improve service delivery.

### üì¶ Dataset Description

The dataset used is the **‚ÄúMedical Appointment No Shows‚Äù dataset** from Kaggle, containing **110,527 appointment records** collected from a public hospital system in **Brazil**. Each row represents a patient appointment and includes the following key attributes:

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |

| `AppointmentDay`      | Date of the actual appointment                                               |
| `Age`                 | Patient‚Äôs age                                                               |
| `Neighbourhood`       | Location of the hospital                                                    |
| `Scholarship`         | Indicates if the patient is enrolled in a social welfare program (1 = Yes)  |
| `Hipertension`        | Whether the patient has hypertension (1 = Yes)                              |
| `Diabetes`            | Whether the patient has diabetes (1 = Yes)                                  |
| `Alcoholism`          | Whether the patient has alcoholism (1 = Yes)                                |
| `Handcap`            | Whether the patient has any disability (0‚Äì4 scale)                          |
| `SMS_received`        | Whether the patient received a reminder SMS (1 = Yes)                       |
| `No-show`             | Target variable ‚Äî indicates if the patient missed the appointment (Yes/No)  |

From this dataset, additional features such as **waiting time** (difference between scheduled and appointment date) and **day of the week** were engineered to uncover deeper insights.

This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing patient behavior and improving appointment management systems using data science.
